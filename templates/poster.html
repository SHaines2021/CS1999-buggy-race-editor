  <h2>Task List Summary:</h2>
  <hr>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-GET</h2>
    <p>
      I forked the repo on GitHub and then used <code>git clone</code> to make a local copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the repo was on my own machine I was able to commit changes to version control
      as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo at the end of each task.
      I followed GitHub's instructions and set up a SSH key so I didn't need to enter
      username and password every time I pushed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-GET Get the source code</h2>
    <p>
      Logging into the buggy server, VSCode and then GitHub allowed for automatic population of the required files.
    </p>
    <p>
      This task required starting from scratch- setting up a Github account, downloading and navigating VSCode for the first time.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-RUN Get app running and view it in a browser</h2>
    <p>
      Opened VSCode workspace, successfully ran the app.py code and opened the server link.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-CHANGE Make a change to a template and see it appear</h2>
    <p>
      Altered the heading of the Index page and witnessed the update in the live page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changed this to "Sarah's Buggy Editor".
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-TEMPLATE Add a new template to the app</h2>
    <p>
      Added an info page template to the app, this includes an <code>iframe</code> that links to the server so it does not go out of date if the racing server is updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially I looked into web-scraping this data with BeautifulSoup but it seemed like an excessive amount of effort for the desired effect. I then copied the original source code from the server in as a placeholder before replacing it with the <code>iframe</code>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-ADD Add more data to the form</h2>
    <p>
      Added <code>flag_color</code> to the form
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done because it already existed in the database, ready for use.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-VALID Add basic data validation</h2>
    <p>
      Added a simple statement to validate if the input for <code>qty_wheels</code> was a digit or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also added in a flash message here to alert in the event of failure. This meant that the form page could be reloaded, rather than the update page displaying the fail and having to backtrack to fix it.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-STYLE Style your editor just how you like it</h2>
    <p>
      Basic updates to the app style were made, particularly around the colour selections and font.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minimalist, high contrast style was selected for this task.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-EDIT Edit the record by loading its current values into the form</h2>
    <p>
      Added the current values into the form and rendered the template with these in place
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done by reusing the SQL code for fetching the record from app.py and placing it in the GET method then rendering the template with this as the data
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-FORM Make the form better</h2>
    <p>
      Added in all the buggy attributes to the form, also added dropdown menus for all named fields to ensure valid entries and facilitate rapid form filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of these! But as the races were not live at the time of writing, I wanted to ensure that the output of the app would result in a valid buggy that was ready for racing. The dropdown menus allow for pre-selected values, so the content of these was imported from the current buggy record. This works well but does mean that on first opening some items may be listed twice (ie. petrol, petrol, fusion, steam), but this does not alter its functionality.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-COST Calculate and save the game cost of the buggy</h2>
    <p>
      Imported costs from the racing server JSON API and added if statements to handle 0 cost where items were not used.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JSON import ensures that any cost updates will be immediately reflected in the buggy editor. It also allows for a dictionary-type look up of each element. Costs were also calculated by sub-category for ease of modification between race budgets.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-RULES Add validation according to the game rules</h2>
    <p>
      Rules for the form data were added as if statements to ensure only valid entries were saved to buggies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each error results in a flash message about it's content (ie. "Oops! Please enter at least 0 attacks. (qty_attacks)") giving an outline of the error and it's location. This was later updated so that all the <code>.isdigit </code>functions were in the same loop. An attempt was made to put the results of these errors into a function, but it was not possible to get the template to render form the return of these. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-ENV Switch between dev and production environments</h2>
    <p>
      Switched between the two environments successfully
    </p>
    <p>
      Ran and tested both versions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-AUTOFILL Add auto-fill to the edit forms</h2>
    <p>
      Added buttons to the form that filled and submitted a buggy. Either a buggy with random values or one with default values.
    </p>
    <p>
      This route was taken as the form was already filled with default values upon opening (from 2-edit), it would have been great to have this functionality through javascript as you fill out the form, however, this was not possible in the time. Buttons allow for the records to be populated and submitted but as it's server side rather than client side, the values aren't visible until the buggy is view in the summary page. The random values have set lists for colours and numbers so that the <code>random.choice</code> function could be used, but these are not exhaustive.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-MULTI Allow different buggies to be created</h2>
    <p>
      Added the functionality to allow for multiple buggies
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done in association with the course videos. This code meant that the auto-fill no longer functioned as it needed to pass a None record into the buggy creation template. This was fixed by updating the init_db.py file to include a complete default buggy (not just 4-wheels), then calling this into the form. This did, however, mean that where there was a data validation error it would reset this ID to 0, modifying this default. So code was added to delete the id before loading the template for data validation. This would have been better in a function, but as above, the template render did not work. Additionally, the buggy ID is hidden from the user and automatically increments. This means that no numbers are skipped.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-DEL Allow buggies to be deleted</h2>
    <p>
      Added the functionality to delete individual buggies
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done in association with the course videos. Due to the fact that the buggy IDs increment automatically, if buggies 1,2,3 existed and 2 was deleted, and a new buggy was created, this would increment to 1,3,4. If more time was available then functionality to review the IDs in use and back fill any missing ones would be desirable.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-FLAG Display the pennant graphically</h2>
    <p>
      Flag colours and patterns displayed within the buggy summary page, within a cell of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done through an if statement to determine the flag pattern style, then by selecting the correct table cell that featured the modified style of that pattern. The colours of the flag were pulled from the buggy record.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-TESTS Write some tests</h2>
    <p>
      Manual walkthrough testing details are outlined in the testing.md document
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of this task a large number of potential testing methods were attempted with the view to generating an automatic test set. This proved not to be possible within the remaining time. If more time were available then an automatic testing suite could be written in pytest or unittest generating a duplicate/test database and unit tests for each functional block of the application code and verification statements like <code>AssertTrue(x) </code> to determine a range of pass/fail criterions. For example, with the input of a dummy buggy record it would be possible to quickly test if the cost calculations, database and form were capable of functioning as anticipated. After this boarder/edge values could then be added to the trial to ensure greater stability. This may include a very large number of wheels, symbols or decimals.
